# HellboyPortfolio
A collection of a couple of the systems I worked on while making Hellboy: Web of Wyrd. Thank you to Upstream Arcade for allowing me to share this work.

This repository will serve as a library for some of my favourite systems that I worked on during the development of Hellboy from November 2021 - October 2023. I will leave all comments intact to show how they were maintained in the actual project, but will also be providing some extra notes to provide context about:

  - What the goal of the systems was
  - My thought processes behind the systems
  - Any limitations that needed to be worked around
  - How the systems morphed as the project grew

Some of the .cs files have had their formatting changed by being uploaded to this repository - if something looks strange then downloading it and viewing in Visual Studio will show how it looked during development.
